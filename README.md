## Researched on Enhancement to N-gram Word Prediction System
We developed four word prediction systems based on some novel enhancement to our baseline algorithm, the pure N-gram model. The enhancement includes POStag prediction, weighted POS-Ngram model, and dynamic corpus selection using topic modeling. The accuracy and keystroke saving evaluation of these four systems indicates that the Topic-BasedWeighted-POS-Ngram model has both the highest accuracy and keystroke saving rate. It achieves a 6% higher accuracy and a 3% higher keystroke saving than the baseline system. Finally, the best model has an accuracy of 28.37% and a keystroke saving of 15%.
